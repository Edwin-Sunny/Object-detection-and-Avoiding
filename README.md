IoT Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Device

Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an IoT device designed to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time. The device scans its environment using sensors and adjusts its path to navigate around obstacles autonomously.

Features

Obstacle Detection: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles within a specified range.
Obstacle Avoidance: Implements algorithms to change direction when an obstacle is detected.
Scanning Capability: Continuously scans the environment for obstacles, providing real-time feedback.
Remote Monitoring: Includes a user interface for remotely monitoring and controlling the device.
